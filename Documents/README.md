# Hive Sentinel Project Objectives

## Objectives

1. **Comprehensive Control Management System:** Design and implement a specialized control management system tailored explicitly for honeypots.

2. **Continuous Monitoring:** Monitor the health, performance, and security of honeypots in real-time, including system resources, network connectivity, and application services.

3. **Real-time Detection and Alerting:** Detect and immediately alert administrators about suspicious or malicious activities targeting the honeypots.

4. **Security Measures Implementation:** Incorporate robust security measures, including encryption, access controls, and intrusion detection, to safeguard collected data.

5. **Detailed Logging and Reporting:** Provide detailed logs, reports, and analysis of honeypot activities for threat intelligence purposes.

6. **Snapshot Restoration Capabilities:** Implement snapshot restoration capabilities to reset honeypots to a clean state after attacks or specific penetration levels.

7. **Integration with Security Infrastructure:** Integrate the monitoring system with other security infrastructure, such as SIEM systems, for centralized monitoring and correlation of security events.

## Project Overview
